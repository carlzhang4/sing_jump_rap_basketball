HiFive1 is a low-cost, Arduino-compatible development board featuring the Freedom E310. It’s the best way to start prototyping and developing your RISC‑V applications.

This target is ideal for getting familiarize with RISC-V ISA instructions set and freedom-metal libraries. It supports:

- 1 hart with RV32IMAC core
- 4 hardware breakpoints
- 16 local interrupts signal that can be connected to off core complex devices
- Up to 127 PLIC interrupt signals that can be connected to off core complex devices, with 7 priority levels
- GPIO memory with 16 interrupt lines
- SPI memory with 1 interrupt line
- Serial port with 1 interrupt line
- 1 RGB LEDS
