The SiFive E76 Standard Core is a high-performance 32-bit embedded processor which is fully-compliant with the RISC-V ISA. Its advanced memory subsystem enables inclusion of tightly-integrated memory and caches.

The E76 is ideal for applications which require high performance -- but have power constraints (e.g., Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality , IoT Edge Compute, Biometric Signal Processing, and Industrial Automation).

This FPGA core target is ideal for makers and hobbyists to develop running application software building on top of freedom-metal libraries. The target supports:

- 1 hart with RV32IMAFC core
- 4 hardware breakpoints
- Physical Memory Protection with 8 regions
- 16 local interrupts signal that can be connected to off core complex devices
- Up to 127 PLIC interrupt signals that can be connected to off core complex devices, with 7 priority levels
- GPIO memory with 16 interrupt lines
- SPI memory with 1 interrupt line
- Serial port with 1 interrupt line
- 4 RGB LEDS
- 4 Buttons and 4 Switches
