The SiFive E31 Standard Core is the world’s most deployed RISC-V core. Co-designed alongside the RISC-V ISA, the E31 takes maximum advantage of the RISC-V ISA, resulting in a power-efficient core that delivers the high performance needed for tomorrow’s smart IoT, storage, and industrial applications.

This FPGA core target is ideal for makers and hobbyists to develop running application software building on top of freedom-metal libraries. The target supports:

- 1 hart with RV32IMAC core
- 4 hardware breakpoints
- Physical Memory Protection with 8 regions
- 16 local interrupts signal that can be connected to off core complex devices
- Up to 127 PLIC interrupt signals that can be connected to off core complex devices, with 7 priority levels
- GPIO memory with 16 interrupt lines
- SPI memory with 1 interrupt line
- Serial port with 1 interrupt line
- 4 RGB LEDS
- 4 Buttons and 4 Switches
