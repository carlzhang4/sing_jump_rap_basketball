The SiFive E24 Standard Core is a high-performance microcontroller with hardware support for single-precision floating-point capabilities by implementing the RISC-V ISA’s F standard extension. The E24’s efficiency, coupled with hardware floating-point capabilities, make it exceptional at motor control, sensor fusion, and IoT applications.

This FPGA core target is ideal for makers and hobbyists to develop running application software building on top of freedom-metal libraries. The target supports:

- 1 hart with RV32IMAFC core
- 4 hardware breakpoints
- Physical Memory Protection with 4 regions
- Up to 153 CLIC interrupt signals that can be connected to off core complex devices, with 16 levels
- GPIO memory with 16 interrupt lines
- SPI memory with 1 interrupt line
- Serial port with 1 interrupt line
- 4 RGB LEDS
- 4 Buttons and 4 Switches
