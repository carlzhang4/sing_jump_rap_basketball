The SiFive E24 Standard Core is a high-performance microcontroller with hardware support for single-precision floating-point capabilities by implementing the RISC-V ISA’s F standard extension. The E24’s efficiency, coupled with hardware floating-point capabilities, make it exceptional at motor control, sensor fusion, and IoT applications.

This core target is suitable with Verilog RTL for verification and running application software building on top of freedom-metal libraries. The target supports:

- 1 hart with RV32IMAFC core
- 4 hardware breakpoints
- Physical Memory Protection with 4 regions
