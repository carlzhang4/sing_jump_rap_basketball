The SiFive E21 Standard Core is a high-performance, full-featured embedded processor designed to address advanced microcontroller applications such as Sensor Fusion, Smart IoT, Wearables, Connected Toys, and more. Separate Instruction and Data Buses, along with 2 banks of Tightly Integrated Memory (TIMs) make the E21 an ideal choice for applications with deterministic or demanding memory requirements.

This FPGA core target is ideal for makers and hobbyists to develop running application software building on top of freedom-metal libraries. The target supports:

- 1 hart with RV32IMAC core
- 4 hardware breakpoints
- Physical Memory Protection with 4 regions
- Up to 153 CLIC interrupt signals that can be connected to off core complex devices, with 16 levels
- GPIO memory with 16 interrupt lines
- SPI memory with 1 interrupt line
- Serial port with 1 interrupt line
- 4 RGB LEDS
- 4 Buttons and 4 Switches
