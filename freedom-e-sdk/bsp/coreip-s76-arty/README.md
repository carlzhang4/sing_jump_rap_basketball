The SiFive S76 Standard Core is a high-performance 64-bit embedded processor which is fully-compliant with the RISC-V ISA.

The S76 is ideal for latency-sensitive applications in domains such as storage and networking that require 64-bit memory addressability (e.g. In-storage Compute, Edge Compute, 5G Modems, Object storage etc.)

This FPGA core target is ideal for makers and hobbyists to develop running application software building on top of freedom-metal libraries. The target supports:

- 1 hart with RV64IMAFDC core
- 4 hardware breakpoints
- Physical Memory Protection with 8 regions
- 16 local interrupts signal that can be connected to off core complex devices
- Up to 127 PLIC interrupt signals that can be connected to off core complex devices, with 7 priority levels
- GPIO memory with 16 interrupt lines
- SPI memory with 1 interrupt line
- Serial port with 1 interrupt line
- 4 RGB LEDS
- 4 Buttons and 4 Switches
